# Max-Flow Algorithm:- Tunnels problem and Gomory-Hu tree

### Files to be submitted for the project evaluation of IT 201 Data Structures and Algorithms course.

Implemented an application for a famous algorithmic problem, namely the tunnels problem solved
using the Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm.

Used the same algorithm to build a Gomory-Hu tree to represent all minimum s-t cuts
for all the s-t pairs in a graph.

### Usage details

1. Clone the repo
2. In the root folder, run: 
```
python main.py
```
